# Project Repository
This repository contains code and documentation for projects created primarily
in the course of my studies.

### iSAX
I implemented an algorithm and accompanying tree structure to facilitate
the performance of fast similarity searches between time series (e.g. stock
prices), for integration into a database *(for Harvard CS207: Systems
Development for Computational Science, May 2016)*.
