# Project Repository
This repository contains code and documentation for projects created primarily
in the course of my studies.

### iSAX
(**Python**) I implemented an algorithm and accompanying tree structure to facilitate
the performance of fast similarity searches between time series (e.g. stock
prices), for integration into a
[database](https://github.com/Mynti207/cs207project)
*(for Harvard CS207: Systems
Development for Computational Science, May 2016)*.

### mastermind
(**Python**) I implemented several algorithms for solving high-dimensional versions
of the classic game, MasterMind, including exhaustive search algorithms and a
local optimization algorithm (simulated annealing). Also created a [video
presentation](https://youtu.be/9VpXru8dRGA) for the
[project](https://github.com/dominedo/am207project)
*(for Harvard AM207: Stochastic Methods for Data Analysis, Inference, and
  Optimization, May 2016)*.

### chess
(**R**) I implemented a variety of statistical and machine learning models
to predict, based on anonymized membership data, whether a member of US chess
would allow their membership to lapse a short time after joining. Predictive
performance was judged through an in-class
[Kaggle competition] (https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/lapsed-uschess-memberships)
in which we placed first
*(for Harvard STAT149: Statistical Sleuthing through Generalized Linear
  Models, May 2016)*.

### bloom
(**C**) As a short exercise in exploring hashing methodologies, we
implemented a Bloom filter in C *(for Harvard CS207: Systems
Development for Computational Science, February 2016)*.
