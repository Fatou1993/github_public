# Project Repository
This repository contains code and documentation for projects created primarily
in the course of my studies.

### iSAX
(Python) I implemented an algorithm and accompanying tree structure to facilitate
the performance of fast similarity searches between time series (e.g. stock
prices), for integration into a
[database](https://github.com/Mynti207/cs207project)
*(for Harvard CS207: Systems
Development for Computational Science, May 2016)*.

### mastermind
(Python) I implemented several algorithms for solving high-dimensional versions
of the classic game, MasterMind, including exhaustive search algorithms and a
local optimization algorithm (simulated annealing). Also created a [video
presentation](https://youtu.be/9VpXru8dRGA) for the project
*(for Harvard AM207: Stochastic Methods for Data Analysis, Inference, and
  Optimization, May 2016)*.
